                <p>Black Noir is the clone of The Homelander, and was created by Vought-American with refined Compound-V. Vought created him as a contingency plan in order to ensure that Homelander never oversteps his bounds, and kill him if he does. Black
                    Noir then became a major member of the Seven, with no one on the team knowing who he was, or where he came from. He had several enemies, such as Coagula, Sexface, and an unnamed naked girl who is a spoof of Poison Ivy.
